## Introduction
This data visualization focuses on telling a story on how social activism reduces sexual harassment. It will start with data on social harassment cases in colleges in the US to give the audiences a sense of the general situation. Then, the project will list several social activism methods that help advocate for the victims of sexual assaults and harassment. More data will be provided to discuss the effectiveness of those activism. The story will mainly focus on introducing Metoo movement to the audiences. 

## Project Structure
1. Introduction on sexual assault and harrasment cases in the US

3. Metoo movement, scopes and examples
4. The effectiveness of Metoo movement
5. What could people do in the future to reduce sexual assault and harrasment cases
