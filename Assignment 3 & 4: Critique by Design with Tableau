### Step One
What I like:
It shows how the trend has changed throughout the years
It shows the countries clearly by creating the flag buttons next to the bars
It has numbers on the bars to quantify the data.
What I don’t like: 
I cannot remember everything after watching the video. If I want to go back and see the specific number in one year, it is difficult to navigate it. 
The pie chart is not helpful in providing information.
The color is confusing and difficult to follow.
What can be changed:
I will make a curve chart to show how the productions change for each country.
I will reduce the number of countries and leave the major ones that show up for longer periods of time.
I will make an interactive chart for the audiences to choose from the countries. 
I will make an average line to show how the average of tomato production changes throughout the years.

### Step Two
Which country produces the most Tomatoes in the World?: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7038221922265915394/

### Step Three
In this visualization,  I intend to create stories focusing on three major areas: China, the US, and USSR (Russia and Ukraine). I also put other countries that are included in the top ten production in the chart to show the scale.

### Step Four
Feedback from friend 1: student, mid-20s
It is a graph that shows the production of tomatoes in different countries over years. It tells that Chinese people love producing tomatoes. Surprisingly, the production of tomatoes in U.S stays very stable
It looks like a graph that would appear in some global farming magazine.
This now looks like a stock pattern...

Feedback from friend 2: student, mid-20s
I think the chart is about comparing which country produced the most tomatoes in the world in a 5-year time frame. Using a line graph is a good way to show the growth of certain values and compare the differences between subjects.
There is a short description at the top of the graph, which directly tells us the focus on the main tomato-producing countries like China and the USSR. The graph shows that the USSR produced the most tomatoes from the 60s to the 90s, but then, they experienced a huge decrease in 

### Step Five
Based on my previous critiques on the original visualization and the peer’s comments, I decide to delete the countries and leave just China and the U.S. to tell a story. 
Previously I included the USSR, Russia and Ukraine in the narrative to show more layers of the data, however, the story they tell is neither comprehensive nor accurate. And the color palette creates confusion for the audience. Thus, I decide to just include two major countries: one is the one that has the largest amount of tomato production in the world, and the other is for the audiences in the US. 
In the final visualization, the story is: what does the US do in tomato production compared to China in the past decades. I selected this visualization because it gets rid of the unnecessary information and presents a clean perspective on one story.
