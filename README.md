# About Me

## My name is Yutong Liu, a filmmaker, film producer, and arts manager originally from Beijing, China. Now I'm pursuing my master of entertainment management degree at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh! After graduation, I want to work as a free-lancing film producer and distributor. Meanwhile, I will develop my own documentary films. My career goal is to create and produce cross-cultural independent films filling the cleavages between Eastern and Western cultures. I love pole-dancing, photography, singing, reading, and learning languages! I can speak Chinese, English, French, and Japanese, and I'm willing to make friends from different parts of the world! 

# What I Want To Learn

## By taking the course Telling Stories with Data, I aim to learn on how to create effective data visualization and create my own portfolio. Beyond, I strive to take up the mindset and a data analyst to perceive the world and its stories in a way that I'm not familiar with before. I believe it will be a perspective-expanding journey for me.

# Portfolio

## The following projects are from the course Telling Stories with Data and beyond. I hope it gives you a sense on how I tell stories with data!
